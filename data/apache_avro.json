  "description": "Apache Avro is a framework for modeling, serializing and making Remote Procedure Calls (RPC). Avro data is described by a schema, and one interesting feature is that the schema is stored in the same file as the data it describes, so files are self-describing. Avro does not require code generation. This framework can compete with other similar tools like: Apache Thrift, Google Protocol Buffers, ZeroC ICE, and so on. ",
