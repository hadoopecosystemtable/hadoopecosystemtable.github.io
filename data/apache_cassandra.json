  "description": "Distributed Non-SQL DBMS, it’s a BDDB. MR can retrieve data from Cassandra. This BDDB can run without HDFS, or on-top of HDFS (DataStax fork of Cassandra).  HBase and its required supporting systems are derived from what is known of the original Google BigTable and Google File System designs (as known from the Google File System paper Google published in 2003, and the BigTable paper published in 2006). Cassandra on the other hand is a recent open source fork of a standalone database system initially coded by Facebook, which while implementing the BigTable data model, uses a system inspired by Amazon’s Dynamo for storing data (in fact much of the initial development work on Cassandra was performed by two Dynamo engineers recruited to Facebook from Amazon).",
