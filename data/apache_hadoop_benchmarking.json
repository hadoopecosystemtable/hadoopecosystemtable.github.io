This JAR are micro-benchmarks for testing particular parts of the infrastructure, for instance TestDFSIO analyzes the disk system, TeraSort evaluates MapReduce tasks, WordCount measures cluster performance, etc. Micro-Benchmarks are packaged in the tests and exmaples JAR files, and you can get a list of them, with descriptions, by invoking the JAR file with no arguments. With regards Apache Hadoop 2.2.0 stable version we have available the following JAR files for test, examples and benchmarking. The Hadoop micro-benchmarks, are bundled in this JAR files: hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.2.0.jar, hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient-2.2.0-tests.jar.",
