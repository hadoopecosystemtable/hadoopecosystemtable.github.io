	"description": "The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) offers a way to store large files across multiple machines. Hadoop and HDFS was derived from Google File System (GFS) paper. Prior to Hadoop 2.0.0, the NameNode was a single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS cluster. With Zookeeper the __HDFS__ High Availability feature addresses this problem by providing the option of running two redundant NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive configuration with a hot standby.",
