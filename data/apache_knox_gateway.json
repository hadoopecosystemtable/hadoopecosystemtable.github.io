{"name":"Apache Knox Gateway","description":" System that provides a single point of secure access for Apache Hadoop clusters. The goal is to simplify Hadoop security for both users (i.e. who access the cluster data and execute jobs) and operators (i.e. who control access and manage the cluster). The Gateway runs as a server (or cluster of servers) that serve one or more Hadoop clusters.","abstract":"","category":"Security","tags":[],"links":[]}
