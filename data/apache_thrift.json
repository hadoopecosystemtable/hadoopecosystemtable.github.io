  "description": "A cross-language RPC framework for service creations. Itâ€™s the service base for Facebook technologies (the original Thrift contributor). Thrift provides a framework for developing and accessing remote services. It allows developers to create services that can be consumed by any application that is written in a language that there are Thrift bindings for. Thrift manages serialization of data to and from a service, as well as the protocol that describes a method invocation, response, etc. Instead of writing all the RPC code -- you can just get straight to your service logic. Thrift uses TCP and so a given service is bound to a particular port.",
