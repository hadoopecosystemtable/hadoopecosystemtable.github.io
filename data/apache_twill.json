  "description": "Twill is an abstraction over Apache HadoopÂ® YARN that reduces the complexity of developing distributed applications, allowing developers to focus more on their business logic. Twill uses a simple thread-based model that Java programmers will find familiar. YARN can be viewed as a compute fabric of a cluster, which means YARN applications like Twill will run on any Hadoop 2 cluster.",
