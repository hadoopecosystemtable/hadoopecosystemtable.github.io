  "description": "InfluxDB is an open source distributed time series database with no external dependencies. It's useful for recording metrics, events, and performing analytics.\nIt has a built-in HTTP API so you don't have to write any server side code to get up and running. InfluxDB is designed to be scalable, simple to install and manage, and fast to get data in and out. It aims to answer queries in real-time. That means every data point is indexed as it comes in and is immediately available in queries that should return in \n",
