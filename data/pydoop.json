  "description": "Pydoop is a Python MapReduce and HDFS API for Hadoop, built upon the C++\nPipes and the C libhdfs APIs, that allows to write full-fledged  MapReduce applications with HDFS access. Pydoop has several advantages over Hadoopâ€™s built-in solutions for Python programming, i.e., Hadoop Streaming and Jython: being a CPython package, it allows you to access all standard library and third party modules, some of which may not be available.",
