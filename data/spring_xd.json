  "description": "Spring XD (Xtreme Data) is a evolution of Spring Java application development framework to help Big Data Applications by Pivotal.\nSpringSource was the company created by the founders of the Spring Framework. SpringSource was purchased by VMware where it was \nmaintained for some time as a separate division within VMware. Later VMware, and its parent company EMC Corporation, formally created \na joint venture called Pivotal. Spring XD is more than development framework library, is a distributed, and extensible system for data ingestion,\nreal time analytics, batch processing, and data export. It could be considered as alternative to Apache Flume/Sqoop/Oozie in some scenarios.\nSpring XD is part of Pivotal Spring for Apache Hadoop (SHDP). SHDP, integrated with Spring, Spring Batch and Spring Data are part of \nthe Spring IO Platform as foundational libraries. Building on top of, and extending this foundation, the Spring IO platform provides \nSpring XD as big data runtime. Spring for Apache Hadoop (SHDP) aims to help simplify the development of Hadoop based applications by \nproviding a consistent configuration and API across a wide range of Hadoop ecosystem projects such as Pig, Hive, and Cascading \nin addition to providing extensions to Spring Batch for orchestrating Hadoop based workflows.\n",
