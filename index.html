multiple machines. Hadoop and HDFS was derived from Google File System (GFS) paper. 
Prior to Hadoop 2.0.0, the NameNode was a single point of failure (SPOF) in an HDFS cluster. 
With Zookeeper the HDFS High Availability feature addresses this problem by providing 
the option of running two redundant NameNodes in the same cluster in an Active/Passive 
configuration with a hot standby. </td>

large-scale MapReduce or other batch-processing workloads. It was 
designed as an alternative to Apache Hadoop’s HDFS, intended to deliver 
better performance and cost-efficiency for large-scale processing clusters. 
It is written in C++ and has fixed-footprint memory management. QFS uses 
Reed-Solomon error correction as method for assuring reliable access to data. <br>
Reed–Solomon coding is very widely used in mass storage systems to correct the burst 
errors associated with media defects. Rather than storing three full versions of 
each file like HDFS, resulting in the need for three times more storage, QFS 
only needs 1.5x the raw capacity because it stripes data across nine different disk drives. </td>

intended for larger network and high-availability environments. 
Traditionally, Lustre is configured to manage remote data storage 
disk devices within a Storage Area Network (SAN), which is two or 
more remotely attached disk devices communicating via a Small Computer 
System Interface (SCSI) protocol. This includes Fibre Channel, Fibre 
Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) and even iSCSI. <br>
With Hadoop HDFS  the software needs a dedicated cluster of computers 
on which to run.  But folks who run high performance computing clusters 
for other purposes often don't run HDFS, which leaves them with a bunch 
of computing power, tasks that could almost certainly benefit from a bit 
of map reduce and no way to put that power to work running Hadoop. Intel's 
noticed this and, in version 2.5 of its Hadoop distribution that it quietly 
released last week, has added support for Lustre: the Intel® HPC Distribution 
for Apache Hadoop* Software, a new product that combines Intel Distribution 
for Apache Hadoop software with Intel® Enterprise Edition for Lustre software.

	For I/O intensive jobs GridGain GGFS offers performance close to 100x faster than standard HDFS.
	Paraphrasing Dmitriy Setrakyan from GridGain Systems talking about GGFS regarding Tachyon:<br>
	- GGFS allows read-through and write-through to/from underlying HDFS or any
	other Hadoop compliant file system with zero code change. Essentially GGFS
	entirely removes ETL step from integration.<br>
	- GGFS has ability to pick and choose what folders stay in memory, what
	folders stay on disc, and what folders get synchronized with underlying
	(HD)FS either synchronously or asynchronously.<br>
	- GridGain is working on adding native MapReduce component which will
	provide native complete Hadoop integration without changes in API, like
	Spark currently forces you to do. Essentially GridGain MR+GGFS will allow
	to bring Hadoop completely or partially in-memory in Plug-n-Play fashion

<td>Pig provides an engine for executing data flows in parallel on Hadoop. It includes a language, Pig Latin, for expressing these data flows. Pig Latin includes operators for many of the traditional data operations (join, sort, filter, etc.), as well as the ability for users to develop their own functions for reading, processing, and writing data. Pig runs on Hadoop. It makes use of both the Hadoop Distributed File System, HDFS, and Hadoop’s processing system, MapReduce. <br>
Pig uses MapReduce to execute all of its data processing. It compiles the Pig Latin scripts
that users write into a series of one or more MapReduce jobs that it then executes. Pig Latin looks different from many of the programming languages you have seen. There are no if statements or for loops in Pig Latin. This is because traditional procedural and object-oriented programming languages describe control flow, and data flow is a side effect of the program. Pig Latin instead focuses on data flow.</td>

<td width="20%">JAQL</td>
<td>JAQL is a functional, declarative programming language designed especially for working with large volumes of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. As its name implies, a primary use of JAQL is to handle data stored as JSON documents, but JAQL can work on various types of data. For example, it can support XML, comma-separated values (CSV) data and flat files. A "SQL within JAQL" capability lets programmers work with structured SQL data while employing a JSON data model that's less restrictive than its Structured Query Language counterparts.<br>
Specifically, Jaql allows you to select, join, group, and filter data that is stored in HDFS, much like a blend of Pig and Hive. Jaql’s query language was inspired by many programming and query languages, including Lisp, SQL, XQuery, and Pig. <br>
JAQL was created by workers at IBM Research Labs in 2008 and released to open source. While it continues to be hosted as a project on Google Code, where a downloadable version is available under an Apache 2.0 license, the major development activity around JAQL has remained centered at IBM. The company offers the query language as part of the tools suite associated with InfoSphere BigInsights, its Hadoop platform. Working together with a workflow orchestrator, JAQL is used in BigInsights to exchange data between storage, processing and analytics jobs. It also provides links to external data and services, including relational databases and machine learning data. </td>

Spark is a framework for writing fast, distributed programs. Spark solves similar problems as Hadoop MapReduce does but with a fast in-memory approach and a clean functional style API. With its ability to integrate with Hadoop and inbuilt tools for interactive query analysis (Shark), large-scale graph processing and analysis (Bagel), and real-time analysis (Spark Streaming), it can be interactively used to quickly process and query big data sets.<br>
To make programming faster, Spark provides clean, concise APIs in Scala, Java and Python. You can also use Spark interactively from the Scala and Python shells to rapidly query big datasets. Spark is also the engine behind Shark, a fully Apache Hive-compatible data warehousing system that can run 100x faster than Hive.</td>

Flink is a data processing system and an alternative to Hadoop's MapReduce component. It comes with its own runtime, rather than building on top of MapReduce. As such, it can work completely independently of the Hadoop ecosystem. However, Flink can also access Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS) to read and write data, and Hadoop's next-generation resource manager (YARN) to provision cluster resources. Since most Flink users are using Hadoop HDFS to store their data, it ships already the required libraries to access HDFS.

YARN is an open source application that allows the Hadoop cluster to turn into a collection of virtual machines. Weave, developed by Continuuity and initially housed on Github, is a complementary open source application that uses a programming model similar to Java threads, making it easy to write distributed applications. In order to remove a conflict with a similarly named project on Apache, called "Weaver," Weave's name changed to Twill when it moved to Apache incubation.<br>
Twill functions as a scaled-out proxy. Twill is a middleware layer in between YARN and any application on YARN. When you develop a Twill app, Twill handles APIs in YARN that resemble a multi-threaded application familiar to Java. It is very easy to build multi-processed distributed applications in Twill.</td>

Originally created by Nathan Marz and team at BackType, the project was open sourced after being acquired by Twitter. Storm was initially developed and deployed at BackType in 2011. After 7 months of development BackType was acquired by Twitter in July 2011. Storm was open sourced in September 2011. <br>

<td>Spring XD (Xtreme Data) is a evolution of Spring Java application development framework to help Big Data Applications by Pivotal.
SpringSource was the company created by the founders of the Spring Framework. SpringSource was purchased by VMware where it was 
maintained for some time as a separate division within VMware. Later VMware, and its parent company EMC Corporation, formally created 
a joint venture called Pivotal. Spring XD is more than development framework library, is a distributed, and extensible system for data ingestion,
real time analytics, batch processing, and data export. It could be considered as alternative to Apache Flume/Sqoop/Oozie in some scenarios.
Spring XD is part of Pivotal Spring for Apache Hadoop (SHDP). SHDP, integrated with Spring, Spring Batch and Spring Data are part of 
the Spring IO Platform as foundational libraries. Building on top of, and extending this foundation, the Spring IO platform provides 
Spring XD as big data runtime. Spring for Apache Hadoop (SHDP) aims to help simplify the development of Hadoop based applications by 
providing a consistent configuration and API across a wide range of Hadoop ecosystem projects such as Pig, Hive, and Cascading 
in addition to providing extensions to Spring Batch for orchestrating Hadoop based workflows.
